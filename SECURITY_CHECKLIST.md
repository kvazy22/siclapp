- [ ] Regular security training for team

## Security Tools & Resources

### Recommended Security Tools
- **OWASP ZAP**: Web application security scanner
- **Snyk**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Snyk Code**: Static code analysis
- **Mozilla Observatory**: Security header checker
- **SSL Labs**: SSL/TLS configuration checker

### Security Headers Testing
```bash
# Test security headers
curl -I https://yourdomain.com

# Test CSP headers
curl -H "Accept: text/html" https://yourdomain.com | grep -i "content-security-policy"
```

### SSL/TLS Testing
```bash
# Test SSL configuration
nmap --script ssl-enum-ciphers -p 443 yourdomain.com

# Test with SSL Labs (online)
# https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/
```

### Dependency Security
```bash
# Check for vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Fix vulnerabilities
npm audit fix

# Update dependencies
npm update

# Check outdated packages
npm outdated
```

## Emergency Security Procedures

### If Compromised
1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Change all passwords immediately
   - Revoke all JWT tokens
   - Disable admin access temporarily
   - Check for unauthorized changes

2. **Investigation**
   - Review access logs
   - Check for suspicious files
   - Analyze security events
   - Document the incident

3. **Recovery**
   - Restore from clean backup
   - Update all credentials
   - Implement additional security measures
   - Monitor for further attacks

4. **Post-Incident**
   - Update security procedures
   - Conduct security review
   - Implement lessons learned
   - Update incident response plan
